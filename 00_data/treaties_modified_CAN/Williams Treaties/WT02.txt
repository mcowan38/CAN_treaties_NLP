MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT made this of April, 1923,

BETWEEN:

The Government of the Dominion of Canada, acting herein by the Honourable Charles Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,
of the first part,

AND

The Government of the Province of Ontario, acting herein by the Honourable Beniah Bowman, Minister of Lands and Forests for the said Province,
of the other part

WHEREAS certain Indians of the Chippewa and Mississauga tribes claim that the said tribes were and are entitled to a certain interest in lands in the Province of Ontario to which the Indian title has never been extinguished by surrender or otherwise, the said lands being described as parts of the counties of Renfrew, Hastings, Haliburton, Muskoka, Parry Sound and Nipissing, and being bounded on the south and east by the lands included in the surrenders of the Indian title made on the 18th of November, 1815, the 5th of November, 1818, and November, 1822; on the north by the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers and Lake Nipissing, and on the west by the lands included in the surrender of the Indian title made in 1850, known as the Robinson-Huron surrender, and by the Georgian Bay, the area in question including about 10,719 square miles.

AND WHEREAS a departmental enquiry made by the Department of Indian Affairs indicates that the said claim has such probable validity as to justify and require further investigation, and if found valid to be satisfied on such just and fair terms as may be settled by a treaty of surrender.

NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT made in pursuance of certain statutes of Canada and of the Province of Ontario, both entitled "an Act for the settlement of certain questions between the Governments of Canada and Ontario respecting Indian Lands," the Statute of Canada having been passed in the 54th and 55th years of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria and chaptered 5, and the statute of Ontario in the 54th year of Her Majesty's said reign and chaptered 3.

WITNESSETH THAT the Governments of Canada and of the Province of Ontario have agreed as follows: ---

The Government of Canada will, pursuant to Part I of the Enquiries Act, R.S.C., 1906, c. 104, and amendments, appoint three persons as commissioners to enquire into the validity of the claim of the Chippewa and Mississauga Indians aforesaid, and will empower the said commissioners, in the event of their determining in favour of the validity of the said claim, to negotiate a treaty with the said Indians for the surrender of the said lands upon payment of such compensation as may be fixed by such treaty.
Of the three commissioners so named, one shall be selected by the Government of Canada, who shall be Chairman of the Commission, and the remaining two shall be selected by the Minister of Lands and Forests for the Province of Ontario and notified to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.
The question of the validity of said claim may be determined by any two of the said Commissioners and it shall be necessary that at least two of them of whom the chairman shall be one shall concur in any treaty which may be negotiated.
The expenses of the said commission, including the remuneration and expenses of the commissioners and any expenses incurred for securing the attendance of witnesses or otherwise, shall be payable by the Government of Canada, but the rates of remuneration of each of the commissioners selected by the Minister of Lands and Forests for the Province of Ontario shall be agreed upon between him and the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs before the Constitution of the Commission.
In the event of the commissioners negotiating a treaty with the Indians the compensation to be paid to such Indians shall be payable to the Dominion of Canada by the Province of Ontario from time to time in accordance with the terms of the treaty of surrender, and shall be applied by the Dominion of Canada in accordance with the said terms.
In the event of provision being made by such treaty of surrender for the setting apart of reserves for the Indians, the Dominion of Canada will bear the expense to be incurred in the location and survey thereof, and the Province of Ontario will concur in the setting apart of such reserves.
All such reserves shall be administered by the Dominion of Canada for the benefit of the band or bands of Indians to which each may be allotted; portions thereof may, upon their surrender for the purpose by the said band or bands, be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of by letters patent under the Great Seal of Canada, and the proceeds of such sale, lease or other disposition applied for the benefit of such band or bands, provided, however, that in the event of the band or bands to which any such reserve has been allotted becoming extinct, or if for any other reason such reserve or such portion thereof as remains undisposed of is declared by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to be no longer required for the benefit of the said band or bands, the same shall thereafter be administered by and for the benefit of the Province of Ontario, and any balance of the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of any portion thereof then remaining under the control of the Dominion of Canada shall, so far as the same is not still required to be applied for the benefit of the said band or bands of Indians, be paid to the Province of Ontario, together with accrued unexpended simple interest thereon.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF these presents have been signed by the parties thereto.
