Know all men, we, the chiefs and people of the tribe or family of Whyomilth, who have signed our names and made our marks to this deed on the thirtieth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, do consent to surrender, entirely and for ever to James Douglas, the agent of the Hudson's Bay Company in Vancouver Island, that is to say, for the Governor, Deputy Governor, and Committee of the same, the whole of the lands situated and lying between the north-west corner of Esquimalt, say from the Island inclusive, at the mount of the Saw-mill Stream, and the mountains lying due west and north of that point; this District being on the one side bounded by the lands of the Teechamitsa, and on the other by the lands of the Kasompsom family.

The conditions of our understanding of this sale is this, that our village sites and enclosed fields are to be kept for our own use, for the use of our children, and for those who may follow after us and the land shall be properly surveyed hereafter. It is understood, however, that the land itself, with these small exceptions, becomes the entire property of the white people for ever; it is also understood that we are at liberty to hunt over the unoccupied lands, and to carry on our fisheries as formerly.

We have received, as payment, Forty-five pounds sterling.

In token whereof, we have signed our names and made our marks at Fort Victoria, on the thirtieth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and fifty.
