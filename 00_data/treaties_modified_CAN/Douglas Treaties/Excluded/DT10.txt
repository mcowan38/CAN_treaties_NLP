The conditions of our understanding of this sale is this, that our village sites and enclosed fields are to be kept for our own use, for the use of our children, and for those who may follow after us and the land shall be properly surveyed hereafter. It is understood, however, that the land itself, with these small exceptions, becomes the entire property of the white people for ever; it is also understood that we are at liberty to hunt over the unoccupied lands, and to carry on our fisheries as formerly.

We have received, as payment, Forty-one pounds thirteen shillings and four pence.

In token whereof, we have signed our names and made our marks at Fort Victoria, on the 7th day of February, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two.
