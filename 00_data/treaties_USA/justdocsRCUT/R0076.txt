Upon the cash payments being made, and the bond for deferred payments being delivered by said company as herein required, the Secretary of the Interior shall issue to said company certificates of purchase for the several parcels of said lands as it may require them, each of which certificates shall be deemed and held in all courts evidence of the right ofpossession in said company of the lands described therein, unless such right shall be forfeited as hereinafter provided.

And provided further, that each patent shall contain the condition that the lands granted therein shall be sold by said company within five years from the date of such patent.

In case said company shall fail to pay any part of the amounts herein required to be paid by it, or to execute its bond as herein required, or shall fail to pay any part of the principal or interest of said bond within thirty days from the date when the same becomes due and payable, then it shall forfeit all payments heretofore made by it, and all right, title, and interest in and to all and every part of said lands; and the said lands and improvements shall thereupon be sold, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in parcels not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres each, to the highest bidder for cash, the sale to be made on sealed proposals after proclamation by public advertisement, as provided for the sale of the trust lands of the lowas, and Sacs and Foxes under the second article of the treaty with said tribes of March 6, 1861; provided, that no bid shall be received at less than one dollar; provided, that in case said railroad company, after paying the hand payment and the costs of survey and appraisement herein required, shall forfeit its right of purchase of said lands, any person who may have in good faith purchased any of said lands from it shall have the right to a patent for the lands so purchased, on paying therefor to the Secretary of the Interior at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre. And as about one-fifth of said tract herein particularly described lies in Kansas, it is agreed that the Atchison and Nebraska Railroad Company, a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Kansas, shall have the privilege of purchasing all of said tract lying in Kansas, and the improvements thereon, on the same terms and conditions in every respect whatsoever (except as to the construction of railroad) hereinbefore prescribed for the purchase of the St. Louis and Nebraska Trunk Railroad Company of that part of said tract which lies in Nebraska. But the payment required of said Atchison and Nebraska Railroad Company within sixty days from the promulgation of this treaty shall be three thousand dollars. And in case of the failure of the said Atchison and Nebraska Railroad Company to purchase, or in case of its forfeiture after purchase, such of said lands as lie in Kansas shall be disposed of in the manner prescribed for the disposal of that part of the said tract lying in Nebraska, in case said Saint Louis and Nebraska Trunk Railroad Company should forfeit or fail to purchase the same. Provided that no patent shall issue to said Atchison and Nebraska Railroad Company until it shall have paid in full for said lands and improvements lying in Kansas, and for surveying the same punctually within the time prescribed for like payments by the said Saint Louis and Nebraska Trunk Railroad Company, nor until it shall have constructed twenty miles of railroad from Atchison northwardly in the direction of Omaha.
