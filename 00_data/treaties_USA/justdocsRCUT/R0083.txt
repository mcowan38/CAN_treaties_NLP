And the United States shall accept such conveyance in trust for the sole purpose of executing and canying into effect the requirements o(this agreement in respect to said lands; and is hereby required in so doing, by some duly authorized officer, to execute and deliver a patent to each allottee and purchaser of a town lot, so that he may have the evidence, under the authority and seal of the United States, of a fee-simple title, subject only to the restrictions required by this agreement and specified in the instrument itself.

It is agreed that all the lands within the Indian Territory belonging to the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians shall be allotted to the citizens of said tribes so as to give to each citizen of these tribes (except the freedmen provided for in the treaty of 1866), so far as possible, a fair and equal share thereof, considering the character and fertility of the soil and the location and value of the lands.

That in order to such equal division the lands of the Choctaws and Chickasaws shall be graded and appraised so as to give each citizen, as far as possible, an equal value of land: Provided, That ifit shall be decided that the Chickasaw freedmen are not entitled to the land provided for in the treaty of 1866, and the Choctaw freedmen are, then the lands allotted to the Choctaw freedmen are to be deducted from the portion to be allotted under this agreement to the Choctaw citizens, so as to reduce the allotments to the Choctaw citizens by the value of the same and not affect the value of the allotments to the Chickasaw citizens.

That the freedmen who may be entitled to allotments of forty acres each, under the treaty of 1866, shall be entitled each to land equal in value to forty acres of the average land of the two nations.

That in the appraisement of the lands the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes shall, if they or either of them so desire, each have a representative, to be appointed by their respective governors, to cooperate with the Commission of the United States Government, or anyone making appraisements under its direction, in grading and appraising the lands preparatory to allotment. And the land shall be valued in the appraisement as if in its original condition, excluding the improvements thereon.

The exact terms and considerations for such sales must, however, be first submitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.

It is further agreed that there shall be laid out, under the supervision of said commission and a representative of each of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, if they shall appoint the same, town sites where towns are now located, and at such other places as may be agreed on between said commission and the said representatives, with such limits as may be necessary for the probable early growth of said towns, but not to exceed six hundred and forty acres for any town: Provided, That twelve hundred and eighty acres may be set apart for South McAlester, and twenty-five hundred and sixty acres for Ardmore. But no new town shall be laid off nearer than three miles to an existing town. And said commission shall have prepared correct and proper plots of each town, and file one in the clerk's office of the United States court for the district in which the town is located, and one each with the governors of said nations, and one in the Department of the Interior, to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior before the same shall take effect. When said towns are so laid out, each lot on which permanent and substantial improvements other than fences, tillage, and temporary houses have been made, shall be valued, such value not to include the improvements. And the owner of the improvements on each lot shall have the right to buy the same at the appraised value within thirty days uom date of notice served on him that such lot is for sale; and ifhe desires to purchase the same he shall, in advance, pay into the Treasury of the United States one-half of the appraised value, and the balance in two equal annual installments, and when the entire sum is paid shall be entitled to a patent for said lot, to be issued by the Government of the United States.

And such town governments, when so incorporated and organized, shall possess all the powers, and no other, and exercise all the rights of similar town governments in said State of Arkansas; but no tax shall be assessed against any unsold lots, and no tax levied against lots sold, as herein provided, shall constitute a lien on such lots till same are fully paid for by the purchasers.

That said Commission shall be authorized to locate, within a suitable distance from each town site, not to exceed five acres of land to be used as a cemetery; and when any town has paid into the United States Treasury, to be part of the fund arising from the sale of town lots, ten dollars per acre therefor, such town shall be entitled to a patent for same, and shall dispose of same at reasonable prices, in suitable lots, for burial purposes; the proceeds derived from such sales

to be applied by the town government to the proper improvement and care of said cemetery.

But it is distinctly agreed and understood that all leases heretofore made by citizens to coal companies, including the eleven leases in favor of the Choctaw Coal and Railway Company, and its successors or assigns, mentioned in the act of Congress approved October I, 1890, not now being operated, shall, on ratification of this agreement, terminate and cease: Provided, That the lessees whose leases are hereby terminated shall have the preference when said mines are leased, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, as herein provided.

All coal mines, whether now developed or to be hereafter leased and developed, reserved for the benefit of said tribes, shall be operated as hereinbefore provided, and the royalties therefrom paid into the Treasury of the United States, under such rules and regulations as shall be made by the Secretary of the Interior: Provided, That no individual royalties shall be paid on any mines hereafter opened, and no such royalties shall be paid on mines now being operated after two years from January 1, 1897. But the agreement for the payment of individual royalties to continue for said period shall not be construed into an admission or recognition of the right of said parties to receive the same: Provided

further, That no royalty, less than one-half cent per bushel, shall be paid for the benefit of the tribes by the lessees of the mines now being operated, where private royalties are paid, and up to two years from January 1, 1897, no less royalty than three-fourths of a cent per bushel shall be paid to the tribes on coal taken from mines hereafter leased and developed. After the expiration of said two years no royalty less than one-half a cent per bushel shall be paid by the lessees of any mine now developed or undeveloped.

The minerals, other than coal, herein exempted from division, shall be subject to such regulations as shall be made by the Secretary of the Interior in leasing or operating the same for the benefit of their school funds.

That whenever the citizens of the Choctaw or Chickasaw tribes shall be required to pay taxes for the support of schools, then the funds arising from such royalties shall be disposed of for the equal benefit of their citizens (freedmen excepted) as such tribes may direct.

It is further agreed that the United States courts now existing, or that may hereafter be created, in the Indian Territory shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies growing out of the title, ownership, occupation, possession, or use of real estate and minerals, including oil, coal, natural gas, and asphalt, in the territory occupied by the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes; and of all persons charged with homicide, embezzlement, bribery, and embracery, hereafter committed in the territory of said tribes, without reference to race or citizenship of the person or persons charged with such crime; and any citizen or officer of the Choctaw or Chickasaw nations charged with such crime shall be tried, and, if convicted, punished as though he were a citizen or officer of the United States.

And sections sixteen hundred and thirty-six to sixteen hundred and forty-four, inclusive, entitled "Embezzlement," and sections seventeen hundred and eleven to seventeen hundred and eighteen, inclusive, entitled "Bribery and embracery," of Mansfield's Digest of the laws of Arkansas, are hereby extended over and put in force in the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations; and the word "officer," where the same appears in said laws, shall include all officers of the Choctaw or Chickasaw governrnents; and the fifteenth section of the act of Congres§, entitled "An act to establish United States courts in the Indian Territory, and for other purposes," approved March 1, 1889, limiting jurors to citizens of the United States, shall be held not to apply to United States courts in the Indian Territory held within the limits of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations; and all citizens of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, otherwise qualified, shall be competent jurors in said courts: Provided, That whenever a citizen of the Choctaw or Chickasaw nations is indicted for homicide, he may, within ten days after such indictment and his arrest thereon, and before the same is reached for trial, file with the clerk of the court in which he is indicted, his affidavit that he can not get a fair trial in said court; and it shall thereupon be the duty of the judge of said court to order a change of venue in such case to the United States district court of the western district of Arkansas, at Fort Smith, Arkansas, or to the United States district court for the eastern district of Texas, at Paris, Texas, always selecting the court that, in his judgment, is nearest or most convenient to the place where the crime charged in the indictment is supposed to have been committed; and in all said civil suits said courts shall have full equity powers; and whenever it shall appear to said court, at any stage in the hearing of any case, that the tribe is in any way interested in the subject-matter in controversy, it shall have power to summon in said tribe and make the same a party to the suit, and proceed therein in all respects as if such tribe were an original party thereto; but in no case shall suit be instituted against the tribal government without its consent.

It is further agreed that no act, ordinance, or resolution of the council of either the Choctaw or Chickasaw tribes, in any manner affecting the land of the tribe, or of individuals after allotment, or the moneys or other property of the tribe or citizens thereof (except appropriations for the regular and necessary expenses of the government of the respective tribes), or the rights of any person to employ any kind of labor, or the rights of persons who have taken or may take the oath of allegiance to the United States, shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States. When such acts, ordinances, or resolutions passed by the council of either of said tribes shall be approved by the governor thereof then it shall be the duty of the national secretary of said tribe to forward them to the President of the United States, duly certified and sealed, who shall, within thirty days after their reception, approve or disapprove the same. Said acts, ordinances, or resolutions when so approved shall be published in at least two newspapers having a bona fide circulation in the tribe to be affected thereby, and when disapproved shall be returned to the council of the tribe enacting the same.

It is further agreed, in view of the modifications oflegislative authority and judicial jurisdiction herein provided, and the necessity of the continuance of the tribal governments so modified, in order to carry out the requirements of this agreement, that the same shall continue for the period of eight years from the fourth day of March next. This stipulation is made in the belief that the tribal governments, so modified, will prove so satisfactory that there will be no need or desire for further change till the lands now occupied by the Five Civilized Tribes shall, in the opinion of Congress, be prepared for admission as a State in the Union. But this provision shall not be construed to be in any respect an abdication by Congress of power at any time to make needful rules and regulations respecting said tribes.

That all per-capita payments hereafter made to the citizens of the Choctaw or Chickasaw nations shall be paid directly to each individual citizen by a bonded officer of the United States, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, which officer shall be required to give strict account for such disbursements to said Secretary.

It is further agreed that all claims of any kind which either the United States may have upon the Choctaw Nation or the Chickasaw Nation, or the Choctaw Nation or the Chickasaw Nation may have upon the United States, may be submitted to the Senate of the United States as a board of arbitrators for final determination, and without any unnecessary delay to make the award and provision for the payment of whatever sum shall be by them awarded.

It is further agreed that all of the funds invested, in lieu of investment, treaty funds, or otherwise, now held by the United States in trust for the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, shall be capitalized within one year after the tribal government shall cease, so far as the same may legally be done, and be appropriated and paid, by some officer of the United States appointed for the purpose, to the Choctaws and Chickasaws (freedmen excepted), per capita, to aid and assist them in improving their homes and lands.

	It is further agreed that the Choctaws and Chickasaws, when their tribal governments cease, shall become possessed

of all the rights and privileges of citizens of the United States.

It is further agreed that the Choctaw orphan lands in the State of Mississippi, yet unsold, shall be taken by the United States at one dollars and twenty-five cents ($1.25) per acre, and the proceeds placed to the credit of the Choctaw orphan fund in the Treasury of the United States-the number of acres to be determined by the General Land Office.

	This agreement shall be binding on the United States when ratified by Congress, and on each tribe or nation, party hereto, whenever ratified by the constituted authorities of that tribe or nation.

	In witness whereof the said commissioners do hereunto affix their names at Muskogee, I. T., this the eighteenth day

of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-six.
