Article 2nd.

Article 3rd. The United States shall within six months from the date of the ratification of this Treaty cause the land ceded by the preceding article and the improvements thereon to be separately appraised at their true value which shall not be less than an average of one dollar and twenty five cents per acre for the land-said appraisement to be made by two disinterested persons one of whom shall be appointed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the other by the Shawnee Council; and such persons as may be owners of improvements on the "Absentee land," their heirs or assigns, shall have the privilege of purchasing in legal sub-divisions, the lands whereon their respective improvements are situate at any time within three months after public official notice of the completion of said appraisement, by paying into the Treasury of the United States the appraised value thereof exclusive of the value of the improvements; and after the expiration of that period, the tracts of land remaining unpaid for by such persons, their heirs or assigns, and the entire residue of the lands, whether improved or unimproved, ceded to the United States by the Second article of this Treaty shall be sold to the highest bidder for cash, upon sealed bids to be duly invited by advertisement; provided that said lands shall be sold in legal sub-divisions not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres, that no sale shall be made for less than the appraised value of the tract and improvements thereon, that the appraisement, sale and all other provisions of this article shall be made and conducted under the direction and supervision of the Secretary of the Interior and that the expenses of said sales shall not exceed the cost of selling other lands of the United States.

Article 4th. Where improvements are owned by individual members of the Tribe, the proceeds of the sale thereof shall be paid to such owner or his heirs; and any of said lands remaining unsold, at the expiration of six months after they are offered for sale under sealed bids as hereinbefore provided, shall be subject to private entry at one dollar and twenty five cents per acre, at the land office of the United States in the District within which they are situate, and upon the payment of the purchase money, under this and the preceding article, a patent in fee simple shall be issued to the purchaser, his heirs or assigns for the land thus purchased and paid for.

Article 5th. The Contract entered into by George W. Mannypenny, Commissioner of Indian Affairs and one E. W. Sehon, who assumed to act in the name and on behalf of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, on the 5th day of March, 1855, being one of great hardship as to the Shawnees and the said Society having engaged in the present rebellion against the laws and authority of the United States before the expiration of said Contract and thereby rendered a compliance with its stipulations impossible; the said contract is hereby declared forfeited; nevertheless ifthe Secretary of the Interior shall be satisfied that under color of said Contract any loyal citizen of the United States has conducted a School and furnished the means for the clothing, boarding and education of the children of the Tribe at the Shawnee Manual labor School, that he shall upon the application of such citizen if made within one year after the ratification of this Treaty cause an account to be taken of the number of said children thus clothed, boarded and instructed during each year, and for what portion of the year, from the first day of October 1854, to the close of said School on the thirtieth day of September 1862; and that he shall also have an accounttaken of the aggregate sum of money which has been paid to or received by such claimant for his services and expenditure and the annual and aggregate value of the rents and profits of the said land and improvements received and enjoyed by him during said period; and should said Secretary determine that said claimant has not been fully and fairly paid, he is hereby authorized to pay him any balance thus found to be due out of any funds now or hereafter, in the hands of the Government to the credit of the Shawnee Indians, not otherwise appropriated; provided, that not more than one hundred dollars shall be allowed for each child for the ordinary scholastic year.

In order to ascertain the necessary facts and fairly adjust said accounts, the Secretary of the Interior may receive, or cause to be taken, the testimony of the parties interested and of residents in the vicinity of the School.

And the Said Missionary Society of Methodist Episcopal Church South having neglected to pay for said three sections of land and having thereby and for the same reasons before stated as affecting the validity of the Contract aforesaid, forfeited all claim or right to any legal or equitable interest in or to the said three sections of land, the provisions in the Treaty of May 10th, 1854 in relation thereto are hereby abrogated and declared null and void; and the Secretary of the Interior shall sell said land upon such terms and in such quantities as he may deem best for the interest of the Tribe and upon the payment of the purchase money a patent in fee simple shall issue to the purchaser, his heirs or assigns.

Article 6th. The tract of land reserved to the Friend's Shawnee labor School by the Second article of the Treaty of May 10th, 1854 may be purchased by said Society or such person as it may designate, by the payment into the Treasury of the United States at any time within one year from the ratification hereof, of one dollar and twenty five cents per acre.
