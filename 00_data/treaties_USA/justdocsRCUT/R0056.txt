Whereas it is stipulated in the 2d article of the treaty with the Delawares of the 30th of May, 1860, that the improvements of Indians residing upon certain lands by said treaty provided to be sold to the Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Company, should be valued by the United States, and that the individual owners thereof should receive the amount realized from the sale of the same, to be expended in the building of other improvements for said Indians, or the lands retained by them, in said treaty specified; and whereas the company signified its assent to become the purchaser of said lands, and the improvements were appraised on the 21 st day of February, 1861, of which the company had due notice, but said company has not yet paid for the same, to the great injury of the Indians owning said improvements: Now it is agreed that, in case said company shall neglect to pay for said improvements at the appraised value thereof, with the interest accrued since the appraisement, within thirty days after the publication of this treaty, that said lands and improvements thereon situated, to the extent of one section to each improvement, shall be sold by the Secretary of the Interior for the best price the same will bring, upon sealed proposals being duly invited by public advertisement, so as to secure the best price for the same; and from the proceeds of the sale there shall be set apart the appraised value of the lands without the improvements, for the use of the Delawares, to be added to their other trust funds; the remainder, to the extent of the appraised value of the improvements and interest from the date of appraisement aforesaid, shall be paid to the Indian owning said improvement; and if there shall be an excess, the same shall be paid to the general trust fund of the Delawares.

ARTICLE II.

ARTICLE III.

All children of Delaware blood born since the former allotments were made shall be entitled to lands in equal proportion to those to whom tracts have been allotted; and, after said allotments shall have been made, as the Delaware_ will still have remaining a large tract of country, and a large portion of the Delawares are desirous of seeking a new home in or near the Indian country, and those desiring to emigrate, as well as those wishing to remain, are of the opinion that it is for their interest to sell, in a body, all their lands not excepted by the provisions of this treaty, and in the hope and belief that, by so doing, they will benefit the government, the parties hereto therefore agree that in case the Delawares shall, with the consent of the President, agree with the Indians in that country for a tract of land in all respects according to their wishes, or shall elect to settle upon the lands acquired from the Osages, at the price per acre by the United States paid for the same, then it shall be lawful for the Secretary of the Interior to sell all the lands conveyed to said nation of Indians by the supplemental treaty of September 24, 1829, now remaining undisposed of by them, or unsold for them, by the United States, at $2.50 per acre, excepting therefrom such tracts or parcels as may be otherwise disposed of by this treaty to the Union Pacific Railway Company, eastern division, a corporation chartered by the legislature of the State of Kansas, or its assigns, to aid said company or its assigns in building, equipping, and running its railroad, with a third rail, to be of the same gauge of the Pacific railroad of Missouri, and connecting therewith at or near the mouth of the Kansas river, to Fort Leavenworth.
