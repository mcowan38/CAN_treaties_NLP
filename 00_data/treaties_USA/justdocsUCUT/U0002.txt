Whereas a large part of the Tuscarora nation of Indians reside at so remote a distance from the State of North Carolina that they are unable to derive any benefit from the lands, the use of which had been granted to the nation by the Legislature of that State, so long as they should occupy and live upon the same:

And whereas the legislature of the State of North Carolina, in directing the use of the said lands, had heretofore permitted certain leases to be made of part thereof, and difficulties have arisen in the payment and receipt of the rents becoming due thereon:

And whereas, for the purpose of preventing any disputes that might arise respecting the future occupancy of said lands, or the direction of the use thereof, and to remove the difficulties aforesaid, the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, hath appointed Willim Richardson Davie, of North Carolina, commissioner on the part of the United States, for the purposes aforesaid; and the said William Richardson Davie, on the part of the United States, and the undersigned chiefs, in their own names, and in behalf of the whole Tuscarora nation, have agreed to the following articles, namely:

The undersigned chiefs, in their own names, and in behalf of the whole of the Tuscarora nation, hereby stipulate and agree, that, from and after the said twelfth day of July, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixteen, all the right, interest, and claim, of the said nation, or any of the Indians thereof, by act of the General Assembly of the State of Nort Carolina, or otherwise, to the use, possession, or occupancy, of a certain tract of land, allotted to them by the Legislature of the said State, situated in the county of Bertie, in the State aforesaid, bounded and described as follows, viz: Beginning at the mouth of Quitsnoy swamp, running up the said swamp four hundred and thirty poles, to a scrubby oak, near the head of said swamp, by a great spring; then ten degrees, east eight hundred and fifty poles, to a persimmon tree, in R swamp, and along the swamp and pocoson, main course north fifty-seven degrees west, two thousand six hundred and forty poles, to a hickory on the east side of the Falling run or Deep creek, and down the various courses of the said run.
