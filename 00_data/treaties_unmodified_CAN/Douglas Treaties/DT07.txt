Know all men, we, the chiefs and people of family of Ka-ky-aakan, acting for and with the consent of our people, who being here present have individually and collectively confirmed and ratified this act. Now know that we, who have signed our names and made our marks to this deed on the first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, do consent to surrender, entirely and for ever to James Douglas, the agent of the Hudson's Bay Company in Vancouver Island, that is to say, for the Governor, Deputy Governor, and Committee of the same, the whole of the lands situated and lying between Point Albert and the Inlet of Whoyung, on the Straits of Juan de Fuca and the snow covered mountains in the interior of the Island, so as to embrace the whole tract of District of Metchosin, from the coast to these said mountains.

The conditions of our understanding of this sale is this, that our village sites and enclosed fields are to be kept for our own use, for the use of our children, and for those who may follow after us and the land shall be properly surveyed hereafter. It is understood, however, that the land itself, with these small exceptions, becomes the entire property of the white people for ever; it is also understood that we are at liberty to hunt over the unoccupied lands, and to carry on our fisheries as formerly.

We have received, as payment, Forty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence.

In token whereof, we have signed our names and made our marks at Fort Victoria, on the first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and fifty.
