P.C. No. 650

On a Report dated 28th June 1877 from the Honourable the Minister of the Interior stating that it having been decided that a Treaty should be made this year with the Blackfeet and other Indians occupying the unceded territory North of the Boundary Line, East of the Rocky Mountains, and West and South of Treaties Nos. 4 and 6, His Honor Lieut. Governor Laird was in the early part of the year instructed to notify the Indians that Commissioners would be sent in the Fall to negotiate a Treaty with them at such time and place as His Honor might appoint for that purpose.

That His Honor has advised the Department that he has accordingly notified the Indians to assemble at Fort MacLeod on the 13th September next to meet the Commissioners to be appointed to negotiate a Treaty with them. That the necessary funds to meet the expense of the Treaty have been duly provided in the Estimates for the coming year.

That the Territory to be included in the proposed Treaty is occupied by the Blackfeet, Crees, Sarcees and Peigans and may be estimated approximately at about 35,000 Square Miles in area.

The Minister recommends that His Honor the Lieutenant Governor of the North West Territories and Lieut. Colonel James F. Macleod, C.M.G., Commissioner of the Mounted Police, be appointed Commissioners for the purpose of negotiating the proposed Treaty.

The Committee submit the foregoing recommendations for approval.
