On a report dated 30th November, 1898, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, stating with reference to his report of the 18th June, 1898, upon which was based the Minute of Council approved on the 27th of the same month, authorizing the appointing of Commissioners to negotiate a treaty with the Indians occupying territory to the north of that already ceded and shown in pink on the attached map, that in that report it was set forth that the Commissioner of the North West Mounted Police had pointed out the desirability of steps being taken for the making of a treaty with the Indians occupying the proposed line of route from Edmonton to Pelly River; that he had intimated that these Indians, as well as the Beaver Indians of the Peace and Nelson Rivers, and the Sicamas and Nihames Indians, were inclined to be turbulent and were liable to give trouble to isolated parties of miners or traders who might be regarded by the Indians as interfering with what they considered their vested rights; and that he had stated that the situation was made more difficult by the presence of the numerous travellers who had come into the country and were scattered at various points between Lesser Slave Lake and Peace River.

The Minister further states that the view of the Commissioner of the North West Mounted Police as to the desirability of making a treaty with these Indians being concurred in by the Indian Commissioner, and the Minister being convinced that in the public interest it was necessary to take at the earliest possible date the suggested step, it was recommended that Commissioners be appointed with full power to negotiate a treaty. An Order in Council as above stated, issued accordingly; and the preliminary arrangements are now being made.

The Minister, in this connection, draws attention to the fact that part of the territory marked "A" on the plan attached is within the boundaries of the Province of British Columbia, and that in the past no treaties such as have been made with the Indians of the North West have been made with any of the Indians whose habitat is west of the Mountains. An arrangement was come to in 1876 under which the British Columbia Government agreed to the setting aside by a Commission subject to the approval of that Government, of land which might be considered necessary for Indian reserves in different parts of the Province, and later on the agreement was varied so as to provide that the setting apart should be made by a Commissioner appointed by the Dominion Government whose allotment would be subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Lands and Works of the Province.

As the Indians to the west of the Mountains are quite distinct from those whose habitat is on the eastern side thereof, no difficulty ever arose in consequence of the different methods of dealing with the Indians on either side of the Mountains. But there can be no doubt that had the division line between the Indians been artificial instead of natural, such difference in treatment would have been fraught with grave danger and have been the fruitful source of much trouble to both the Dominion and the Provincial Governments.

The Minister submits that it will neither be politic nor practicable to exclude from the treaty Indians whose habitat is in the territory lying between the height of land and the eastern boundary of British Columbia, as they know nothing of the artificial boundary, and, being allied to the Indians of Athabasca, will look for the same treatment as is given to the Indians whose habitat is in that district.

Although the rule has been laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that the Province benefitting by a surrender of Indian title should bear the burdens incident to that surrender, he the Minister after careful consideration does not think it desirable that any demand should be made upon the Province of British Columbia for any money payment in connection with the proposed treaty.

That from the information in possession of the Department of Indian Affairs it is not at present clear whether it will be necessary to set apart any land for a reserve or reserves for Indians in that part of the Province of British Columbia which will be covered by the proposed treaty, but if the Commissioners should find it necessary to agree to the setting apart of any reserve or reserves in that territory, the Minister is of opinion that the same may properly be set aside under the agreement of 1876 already referred to.

As it is in the interest of the Province of British Columbia, as well as in that of the Dominion, that the country to be treated for should be thrown open to development and the lives and property of those who may enter therein safeguarded by the making of provision which will remove all hostile feeling from the minds of the Indians and lead them to peacefully acquiesce in the changing conditions, he the Minister would suggest that the Government of British Columbia be apprised of the intention to negotiate the proposed treaty; and as it is of the utmost importance that the Commissioners should have full power to give such guarantees as may be found necessary in regard to the setting apart of land for reserves the Minister further recommends that the Government of British Columbia be asked to formally acquiesce in the action taken by Your Excellency's Government in the matter and to intimate its readiness to confirm any reserves which it may be found necessary to set apart within the portion of the Province already described.

The Minister further recommends that a certified copy of this Minute, if approved, and of the map attached hereto be transmitted to the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of British Columbia for the information of his Government.

The Committee submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.
