Dans un mémoire de l'honorable ministre de l'Intérieur en date du 27 avril 1875 signalant la très grande insatisfaction des Indiens à l'égard des «promesses ultérieures» aux traités nos 1 et 2 conclus avec les Indiens du Manitoba et des Territoires du Nord-Ouest les 3 et 21 août 1871 respectivement, et faisant les recommandations suivantes:

On a memorandum dated 27th April, 1875, from the Honourable the Minister of the Interior, bringing under consideration the very unsatisfactory state of affairs arising out of the so-called "outside promises" in connection with the Indian Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, Manitoba and North-west Territories, concluded, the former on the 3rd August, 1871, and the latter on 21st of the same month, and recommending for the reasons stated:

1st. That the written memorandum attached to Treaty No. 1 be considered as part of that Treaty and of Treaty No. 2, and that the Indian Commissioner be instructed to carry out the promises therein contained, in so far as they have not yet been carried out, and that the Commissioner be advised to inform the Indians that he has been authorized so to do.

2nd. That the Indian Commissioner be instructed to inform the Indians, parties to Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, that, while the Government cannot admit their claim to any thing which is not set forth in the treaty, and in the memorandum attached thereto, which treaty is binding alike upon the Government and upon the Indians, yet, as there seems to have been some misunderstanding between the Indian Commissioner and the Indians in the matter of Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, the Government, out of good feeling to the Indians and as a matter of benevolence, is willing to raise the annual payment to each Indian under Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, from $3 to $5 per annum, and make payment over and above such sum of $5, of $20 each and every year to each Chief, and a suit of clothing every three years to each Chief and each Headman, allowing two Headmen to each band, on the express understanding, however, that each Chief or other Indian who shall receive such increased annuity or annual payment shall be held to abandon all claim whatever against the Government in connection with the so-called "outside promises," other than those contained in the memorandum attached to the treaty

The Committee submit the foregoing recommendation for Your Excellency's approval:

W.A. HIMSWORTH,
Clerk Privy Council.

Certified,
W.A. HIMSWORTH,
Clerk Privy Council.



We, the undersigned Chiefs and Headmen of Indian bands, representing bands of Indians who were parties to the Treaties Nos. 1 and 2, mentioned in the report of the Committee of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada, above printed, having had communication thereof, and fully understanding the same assent thereto and accept the increase of annuities therein mentioned, on the condition therein stated, and with the assent and approval of their several bands, it being agreed, however, with the Queen's Commissioners, that the number of braves and councillors for each Chief shall be four, as at present, instead of two, as printed 1875.
