To the Sauking:

MY CHILDREN,

You have heard the proposal I have just made to the Chippewas and Ottawas, by which it has been agreed between them and your Great Father that these islands (Manatoulin), on which we are now assembled, should be made, in Council, the property (under your Great Father's control) of all Indians whom he shall allow to reside on them.

I now propose to you that you should surrender to your Great Father the Sauking Territory you at present occupy, and that you should repair either to this island or to that part of your territory which lies on the north of Owen Sound, upon which proper houses shall be built for you, and proper assistance given to enable you to become civilized and to cultivate land, which you Great Father engages for ever to protect for you from the encroachments of the whites.

Are you there, the Saukin Indians, willing to accede to this arrangement; if so, affix your marks to this my proposal.
