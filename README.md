## Abstract
This study examines the applicability of Arthur Spirling's (2012) quantitative methodology, which identified tonal shifts in U.S.–Indian treaties corresponding to historical events, to the analysis of Canadian-Indigenous treaties. Employing string kernel principal components analysis (KPCA) on a comprehensive corpus of Canadian treaties, we sought to uncover linguistic patterns and shifts over time. Contrary to findings in the U.S. context, our analysis reveals a remarkable linguistic consistency in Canadian treaties over time, with principal components categorizing treaties based on thematic content rather than tonal shifts linked to historical events -- reflecting the persistent use of formal legal language and the marginalization of Indigenous perspectives in the treaty-making process. The study underscores the limitations of text-as-data approaches in contexts where treaties were drafted without significant Indigenous input and where oral traditions prevail. We advocate for methodological pluralism that moves beyond quantitative categorization, incorporating Indigenous knowledge systems to achieve a more nuanced understanding of treaty relationships.
